The goal of this project is to help you learn the concepts of continuous integration and continuous deployment.  
You will write a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.

### How does it work?

There is a deployment configuration in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that is triggered on a **push** to the **main** branch. If you want to replicate this in your own GitHub repository:

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Edit *index.html* to your liking.  
3. Push to the main branch.
